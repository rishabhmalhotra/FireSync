# FireSync
Python App to sync your music
Amazing work Credits --> Aditya Maru(adityamaru27) and Me of course!!

## What About it?
What does this piece of code do?

Well, that is interesting. First it will prompt you to switch your computer's bluetooth on if it isnt already. 
Next, it'll ask you to connect with an available device.
Once youve done that, just make sure the other device is in hearing range. Your device is the "Server"; it is running some music on youtube or soundcloud or spotify or whatever.
Next up, the other device which is connected will start listening to the music your device is palying.
It will then use some cool code from app called "LyricsLink" which Aditya did amazing work on. (Check out Aditya's profile: adityamaru27) 
And abracdabra! The other "client" device will launch the same music (or song if you prefer) in sync with yours. 
More the devices, louder the music, harder the party!!
Enjoy guys. And amazing work Aditya!
